Inspiration

Going to the doctor is time consuming for some, and for others is very expensive. According to a new Gallup poll, a third of Americans say they arenâ€™t getting the medical care they need because of fear of high cost.
What it does

What it does
Our app takes personalized input data from user using a wearable device, the data can be from heart rate, temperature, to coughing pattern and tells you if you are healthy or need a checkup based on a learning algorithm. You can choose to send your data then to your doctor.
How we built it

How we built it
We used machine learning to build our algorithm based on anomaly detection. The algorithm learned form a set of big data to detect if the person is healthy or need checkup.
Challenges we ran into

Challenges we ran into
The sensors did not give precise results across a huge set of data gathering, and this problem can be overcome with the right hardware (wearable devices).
Accomplishments that we're proud of

Accomplishments that we're proud of
Having individuals getting involved in in their own health care is very important, and we are proud that we tackled this issue in an economic, personalized, and preventive way.
What we learned

What we learned
Big data in medicine is revolutionary, and will change as the world forever.
